> # HTML & JavaScript:

In HTML, JavaScript code is inserted between `<script>` and `</script>` tags.Scripts can be placed in the `<body>`, or in the `<head>` section of an HTML page, or in both.Scripts can also be placed in external files too. To use an external script, put the name of the script file in the src (source) attribute of a `<script>` tag:
```html
<script src="url">
...
</script>
```
