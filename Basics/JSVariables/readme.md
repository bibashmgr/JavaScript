> # Variables In Javascript:

Variables are containers for storing data values.The general rules for constructing names for variables are:

- Name can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
- Name must begin with a letter.
- Name can also begin with `$`(dollarsign) and `_`(underscore).
- Names are case sensitive.
- Reserved words cannot be used as names.

We can declare a JavaScript variable with the `var` keyword:
```js
var variableName;
```

JavaScript can handle many types of data. Strings are written inside double("") or single quotes('') but numbers are written without quotes.If you put a number in quotes, it will be treated as a text string.
```js
var firstNum=100;
```
```js
var firstNum="100";
```
